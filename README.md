# Swing Ratio Analysis

Contains data and analysis code for a study on swing ratios in jazz solo improvisation.

## Usage
The main analysis file is `swing_ratio_anaylsis.R`. Source file (probably, you need to install some missing R packages first), and run `setup_workspace()`. The main data object is `srw_f`. Good luck! 

Raw data is in `data/swing_ratios_raw.csv`. Cleaned, filtered, and annotated data is in `data/swing_ratios_cleaned_with_loudness.csv`.
